This Python script acts as a simple weather data visualization tool. It leverages the OpenWeatherMap API to retrieve weather forecasts and then uses matplotlib to generate visual representations of the data. Here's a detailed look:

Import Libraries:

import requests: This line brings in the requests library, which is used to make HTTP requests to web APIs (like the OpenWeatherMap API).

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt: This imports matplotlib.pyplot, a module that provides tools for creating various types of plots and charts.

import numpy as np: This imports numpy which is used for numerical operations, like creating a sequence of numbers.

API Key:

API_KEY = "88b35a8e74b5cbf4117d0e97329bfd05": This line defines a variable API_KEY to store your OpenWeatherMap API key. You need to replace this placeholder with your actual API key. This key is needed to authenticate your requests to the OpenWeatherMap service.

get_weather_data(city_name) Function:

Purpose: This function is responsible for fetching weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API for a given city.

How it works:

It constructs the API request URL using the base_url and parameters including the city name, your API key, and units which is set to metric (Celsius).

It uses requests.get() to send an HTTP GET request to the API.

It includes error handling using response.raise_for_status(). This will raise an exception if the API returns an error code, preventing the program from continuing with invalid data.

If successful, it converts the JSON response from the API to a Python dictionary using response.json().

If an error occurs during the API request (e.g., network issues), it catches the exception, prints an error message, and returns None.

Why: This function encapsulates the API interaction, making the code more organized and reusable.

extract_relevant_data(data) Function:

Purpose: This function takes the raw JSON data returned by the API and extracts the specific information needed for plotting.

How it works:

It checks if the data is valid (the status code is 200 and contains list of forecasts).

If valid, it extracts timestamps, temperatures, and wind_speeds from the data['list'].

If the data is invalid, it prints an error message and returns empty lists.

Why: This step separates the data retrieval from data processing. It prepares the data in a structured format that is easier to use for generating plots.

create_temperature_plot(temperatures, timestamps, city_name) Function:

Purpose: This function generates a bar plot showing the temperature variations over the forecast period.

How it works:

It creates a range of numerical x-values corresponding to the number of time points.

It creates a figure and an axes object for plotting using plt.figure and plt.bar.

It creates a bar chart of temperature using plt.bar().

It adds labels to the x and y axes and sets the title for the plot.

It sets the x-axis tick labels to display the time from the time stamps, rotating the labels for better readability.

It saves the generated figure to a PNG file and shows it on the screen using plt.show().

plt.tight_layout() is added to make sure labels are not overlapping.

Why: This function provides a visual representation of how the temperature changes over time, making the data easier to understand.

create_windspeed_plot(wind_speeds, timestamps, city_name) Function:

Purpose: This function generates a line plot showing the wind speed variations over the forecast period.

How it works:

It creates a range of numerical x-values corresponding to the number of time points.

It creates a figure and an axes object for plotting using plt.figure and plt.plot.

It creates a line chart of wind speeds using plt.plot()

It adds labels to the x and y axes and sets the title for the plot.

It sets the x-axis tick labels to display the time from the time stamps, rotating the labels for better readability.

It saves the generated figure to a PNG file and shows it on the screen using plt.show().

plt.tight_layout() is added to make sure labels are not overlapping.

Why: This function provides a visual representation of how the wind speeds change over time, making the data easier to understand.

main() Function:

Purpose: This is the main execution point of the script.

How it works:

It sets the city_name variable to the desired city (initially "London").

It calls get_weather_data() to fetch the weather forecast.

If the data is retrieved successfully, it calls extract_relevant_data() to get usable data for plotting.

It calls create_temperature_plot() and create_windspeed_plot() to generate the plots.

Finally, it informs the user that the dashboard is created or prints the error message if weather data could not be retrieved

Why: This function orchestrates all the other functions, defining the program's flow.

if __name__ == "__main__": main():

This standard Python construct ensures that the main() function is executed only when the script is run directly, and not when it's imported as a module in another script.
